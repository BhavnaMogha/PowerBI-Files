Step 1: ETL Tasks (Power Query)



1. Remove Unnecessary Columns

 Which columns are not useful for analysis? Remove them using Power Query.

2. Data Type Correction

Ensure numeric and date columns have the correct data types.

3. Filter Data

Keep only the data for years after 2014.

Create a New Column

Add a column for Profit = Revenue - Expenses (if applicable).

Rename Columns

Rename any cryptic column names to something more user-friendly.

 Step 2: Data Modeling Tasks
Assume youâ€™ll extend this into a star schema later.

Identify Fact and Dimension Columns

Classify the columns into Fact Table (e.g., Revenue, Profit) and Dimensions (e.g., Country, Segment).

Create Date Table

Use DAX to create a calendar table and relate it with the main data table.

Create Relationships

If additional tables are added (e.g., Products, Regions), establish relationships using proper keys.

Step 3: Visualization Questions
These involve interpreting data through visuals in Power BI.

Bar Chart

Show Total Revenue by Country.

Line Chart

Plot Revenue Trend Over Time.

Stacked Column Chart

Revenue by Product and Year.

Tree Map

Visualize Profit by Segment.

Slicer Filters

Add slicers for Year and Region.

Step 4: Simple to Intermediate DAX Queries
Basic Measure

Total Revenue = SUM(Financials[Revenue])
Profit Margin


Profit Margin = DIVIDE(SUM(Financials[Profit]), SUM(Financials[Revenue]))
Year-on-Year Growth


YoY Revenue Growth = 
VAR CurrentRevenue = SUM(Financials[Revenue])
VAR LastYearRevenue = CALCULATE(SUM(Financials[Revenue]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentRevenue - LastYearRevenue, LastYearRevenue)
Top 5 Countries by Profit

Use TOPN DAX + visualization.

Running Total of Revenue

Running Total Revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Financials[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALLSELECTED('Date'),
        'Date'[Date] <= MAX('Date'[Date])
    )
)


Bonus Scenario Task
Business Question:
Which customer segment and country combinations are generating the highest revenue growth year over year

Create a matrix table with rows as Segments, columns as Countries, and values as YoY Revenue Growth.

Highlight top performers using conditional formatting.
